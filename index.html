    <p> Types of player positions GK is short for goalkeeper, goalkeepers jobs are to block the oppositios shots, unlike most players the goalkeeper can use their hands but only in the box.Defenders, the defenders job is to tackle the ball from the opposition and pass it up there are three types of defenders I know they are fullbacks, centerbacks, and wing backs.Midfielders, midfielders literly can do whatever their coach tells them to they can help attackers and help the defenders but their main job is to help pass the ball up field and try to assist attackers.Attackers, attackers job are to mainly score goals their are many types of attackers but here are the main two wingers, wingers mainly dribble the ball up to a crossing area and cross to a striker and if the striker will hit the net they will score a goal. </p>

   <p>football has a lots of rules here are the main ones firstly the most common one is no using hands exept for the goalkeeper,a full mach of football is 90 minutes they split the match two times 45 minutes a half(after 45 minutes both teams have a break for about 20 minutes or so . There are 11 players each side including the goal keeper,no offside (According to the FIFA rulebook, if a player is in an offside position if: He is nearer to his opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent. A violation will occur when he is in an offside position (previous bullet point) at the same time the ball is being passed forward to him.)and lastly you cant hurt a opposition player if you do that the ref will call foul and the opposition will get a free kick or a penalty depending on the situation.
